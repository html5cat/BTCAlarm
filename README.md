# BTCAlarm

App is built on [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) and uses some of the [Atmosphere](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/) packages so you'll need [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite/)

Getting started:
```
npm install -g meteorite

git clone git@github.com:dybskiy/BTCAlarm.git

cd BTCAlarm

mrt --settings settings.json
```

App has my twilio credentials in settins so yeah :)
